<p>Tangren Alexander (1940-2021) was a lesbian feminist philosopher, professor, writer, and doll photographer. </p><p>Dr. Jean Tangren Alexander was born October 22, 1940, in Medford, Oregon, and raised by her parents Chester and Jessie Fitch in Ashland, Oregon.

She was a professor of philosophy at Southern Oregon University from 1974 to 2006. She taught and developed a variety of courses, including cross-disciplinary courses in women&apos;s studies, such as Feminism &amp; Philosophy and Women &amp; Ethics. She was married to Southern Oregon University faculty colleague John Alexander, with whom she had a daughter, Marcella. The couple separated in the 1970s. </p><p>In 1976, Alexander came out as a lesbian and began a prolific writing career.

Under the pseudonym &quot;Pearl Time&apos;sChild,&quot; she was the author of short stories in several of Tee Corrine&apos;s erotic anthologies. The actor Deborah Kerr was a lifelong muse for Alexander and was a frequent topic of her writing.</p><p>Alexander was active in the lesbian land movement community and the creative women&apos;s community in Southern Oregon. She was a co-founding member of the Southern Oregon Women Writers&apos; Group, Gourmet Eating Society, and Chorus, which continues to this day.</p><p>Having been interested in dolls her entire life, Alexander spent much of her later years photographing dolls and using doll photography to portray feminist stories.</p><p>Alexander died at her home in Ashland, Oregon, on March 26, 2021. </p>  </bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_7e6de5e7426a1d4ffaf3356882938d66">
